Landing Page Redesign for AI Voice Agent Agency**

**Objective:** Redesign the existing landing page for an AI voice agent agency. The new design must be highly focused on attracting and converting service-based healthcare practices in the U.S., specifically within the **Dentistry, Concierge/Primary Care, and Weight Loss Clinics** niches. The page should clearly communicate our core service: designing, building, deploying, and managing AI voice agents and voice agent workflows.

**Existing Code Reference:** The Replit agent has access to the current landing page code.

**Target Audience & Their Pain Points:**

*   **Dentistry Specific:** Efficient recall reminders, billing inquiry management.
*   **Concierge/Primary Care Specific:** Meeting 24/7 patient access expectations, managing membership model inquiries.
*   **Weight Loss Clinics Specific:** Supporting long-term patient adherence, managing coaching session logistics.

**Core Services to Highlight:**
*   Custom AI Voice Agent Development (for scheduling, FAQs, lead qualification, etc.)
