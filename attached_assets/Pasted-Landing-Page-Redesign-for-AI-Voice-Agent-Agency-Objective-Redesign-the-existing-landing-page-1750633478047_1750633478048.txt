Landing Page Redesign for AI Voice Agent Agency**

**Objective:** Redesign the existing landing page for an **AI voice agent agency**. The new design must clearly communicate that we provide **custom, tailored AI voice agent solutions and workflow automation services** for service-based healthcare practices in the U.S., specifically within the **Dentistry, Concierge/Primary Care, and Weight Loss Clinics** niches. The page should emphasize our role in **designing, building (using powerful, industry-leading no-code platforms), deploying, and managing** these voice agents to address specific client pain points, rather than selling a pre-packaged software product.

**Existing Code Reference:** The Replit agent has access to the current landing page code.

**Target Audience & Their Pain Points:**

*   **Dentistry Specific:** Efficient recall reminders, billing inquiry management.
*   **Concierge/Primary Care Specific:** Meeting 24/7 patient access expectations, managing membership model inquiries.

    *   **Call to Action (CTA):** Prominent button (e.g., "Schedule a Free Consultation," "Discover Your Custom Solution").

**Technical Instructions for Replit Agent:**
*   Analyze the existing landing page code. Refactor and clean up the code where necessary.
*   Prioritize semantic HTML5 and modern CSS (e.g., Flexbox/Grid for layout).
*   Ensure all new content is integrated seamlessly into the existing structure or a new, logical structure.
*   Focus on clear, concise copy that resonates with healthcare professionals and emphasizes the *service* and *customization* aspects of your agency.
*   **Crucially, do NOT mention specific no-code platforms or tool names (e.g., Vapi, Bland AI) in the generated content.**
*   Do not include any placeholder images unless specifically requested; use generic placeholders or descriptions for image areas.
*   Provide the updated HTML and CSS code.
